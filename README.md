# Coronavirus analysis

This repo analyzes the activity of coronavirus hashtags on twitter. From my outputs I can gather that the amount of COVID-19 related tweets has increased from what it was in the beggining of the data collection in October. As the pandemic gained more media coverage and the number of cases increased, in the months of January and February, the number of tweets with COVID-19 related hashtags increased. Most of the hashtags I monitored were in English, so analyzing the tweets based on language helped to see what amount of the tweets with each hashtag were in English and which were in each other language.  Additionally, since there are many countries that speak the same languages, analyzing the tweets based on country helped to see where exactly these tweets were coming from.  Since there is a possibility that a tweet may not have a country code affiliated with it, I also made sure there was an undefined country option, where these tweets could still be accounted for.
